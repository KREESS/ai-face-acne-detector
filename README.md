# CNN Face Acne Detector

This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect and classify facial acne using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a labeled image dataset of facial skin with various acne conditions and aims to assist in early skin analysis and classification.

## Features
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Custom CNN architecture for acne classification
- Training, validation, and performance metrics
- Future potential: integration with mobile/web skin analysis apps

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
